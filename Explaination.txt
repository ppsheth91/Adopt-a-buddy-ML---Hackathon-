Machine Learning Challenge : Adopt a Buddy ( Hacker Rank)

Problem Statement : To enable that, you have been tasked to build a Machine Learning model 
that determines type and breed of the animal based on its physical attributes and other factors.

Dataset : The dataset consists of parameters such as: 
1) pet_id  : Unique Pet ID
2) issue date : Date on which pet was issued to the shelter
3) listing_date : Date on which pet arrived at the shelter
4) condition : Condition of the pet
5) color_type : color of the pet
6) length : Length of the pet (cms)
7) height : Height of the pet (cms)
8) X1,X2 : Anonymns columns
9) breed_category : Breed category of the per
10) pet_category : category of the pet 

Challenge :

1) This challenge will encourage you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build models that classify images into multiple categories - CNN
2) This challenge will help you to actively enhance your knowledge of multi-label classification. It is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning



### Approach for the Problem:

# Feature Engineeering:

1) Handling the missing values : There are missing values in both the train and test dataset (variable : Condition), So filled the missing values with a new category 
as missing values followed type missing at random 

2) Convert the dates : Listing and Issue dates into datetime format and identified the no. of days between Issue date and Listing date

3) Handling Categorical variables: Applied Label Encoding to convert the colour feature into numerical form

# Data Visualization : Visualied the data & identified yhat length and height does not have any significance on the target variable

# Algorithms :

Applied Logistic Regression, Decision trees, Random Forest, Xgboosting, Catboosting with hyper parameter tuning through which was able to achive 
best accuracy of 90.82% for the model...
